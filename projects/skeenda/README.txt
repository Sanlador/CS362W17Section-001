To compile the program:
	
	make
	
To run the game:
	
	java dominion_v2.PlayDominion <NUMBER 0-12>
	

To run the test with the Junit tools, all files should be put into Eclipse and ran with the eclEmma code Coverage tool. This seemed to be
the only way that I could get the Junit to run on my computer along with any of the code coverage tools. I also believe that OSU's servers
do not have any ability to run a JUnit test without the built in background that eclipse has for JUnit. I tried several solutions to make
running the tests work on OSU servers inluding installing the junit jars and that did not work either. So I just ran on eclipse and it
worked out fine.
